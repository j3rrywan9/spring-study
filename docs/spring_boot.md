It offers four main features that will change the way you develop Spring applications:
* **Spring Boot starters** - Spring Boot starters aggregate common groupings of dependencies into single dependencies that can be added to a project's Maven or Gradle build.
* **Autoconfiguration** - Spring Boot's autoconfiguration feature leverages Spring 4's support for conditional configuration to make reasonable guesses about the beans your application needs and automatically configure them.
* **CLI** - Spring Boot's CLI takes advantage of the Groovy programming language along with autoconfiguration to further simplify Spring application development.
* **Actuator** - The Spring Boot Actuator adds certain management features to a Spring Boot application.
